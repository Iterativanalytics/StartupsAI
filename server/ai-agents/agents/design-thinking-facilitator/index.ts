      content: `Let's dive deep into the Discover phase of Lean Design Thinking‚Ñ¢. This is where we establish the Design Thinking foundation - before building any solution, we must deeply understand the user and their authentic needs.

üîç **DISCOVER PHASE: Problem Discovery (Design Thinking Foundation)**

**Current Context:**
- Business: ${businessContext.name || 'Your venture'}
- Industry: ${businessContext.industry || 'Not specified'}
- Target Users: ${businessContext.targetUsers || 'To be defined'}

**Step 1: Stakeholder Mapping**
Let's identify all the people who are affected by or influence your problem space:

**Primary Stakeholders:**
- End users (who experiences the problem)
- Decision makers (who can solve it)
- Influencers (who can spread the word)
- Blockers (who might resist change)

**Questions to explore:**
1. Who directly experiences the problem you're trying to solve?
2. Who else is involved in the problem space?
3. What are their relationships to each other?
4. Who has the power to make decisions?

**Step 2: Empathy Map Builder**
For each key stakeholder, let's build an empathy map:

**Think & Feel:**
- What do they think about the problem?
- What are their hopes and fears?
- What motivates them?

**See:**
- What do they see in their environment?
- What do they see others doing?
- What trends do they notice?

**Say & Do:**
- What do they say about the problem?
- How do they behave?
- What actions do they take?

**Hear:**
- What do they hear from others?
- What feedback do they receive?
- What influences their thinking?

**Pain Points:**
- What frustrates them?
- What obstacles do they face?
- What keeps them up at night?

**Gains:**
- What would make their life better?
- What do they hope to achieve?
- What would success look like?

**Step 3: User Journey Mapping**
Map the end-to-end experience:

1. **Awareness:** How do they first learn about the problem?
2. **Consideration:** How do they explore solutions?
3. **Decision:** How do they choose what to do?
4. **Usage:** How do they use current solutions?
5. **Support:** How do they get help?
6. **Advocacy:** How do they share their experience?

**Next Steps:**
1. Conduct 5-10 interviews with each stakeholder type
2. Use the empathy map template for each interview
3. Document pain points and opportunities
4. Look for patterns across different stakeholders

üéØ **DEFINE PHASE: Problem Definition**

**From your research, let's create:**

**Step 1: POV Statement Builder**
Use this formula: [User] needs [Need] because [Insight]

**Template:**
- **User:** [Specific user type]
- **Need:** [What they need to accomplish]
- **Insight:** [Why this matters to them]

**Example:**
"Small business owners need a simple way to track inventory because they lose 15% of revenue to stockouts and overstocking."

**Step 2: HMW Question Generator**
Transform your POV into How Might We questions:

**Format:** "How might we [action] so that [outcome]?"

**Examples:**
- How might we help small business owners track inventory so that they never run out of stock?
- How might we simplify inventory management so that owners can focus on growing their business?
- How might we prevent stockouts so that businesses don't lose revenue?

**Step 3: Problem Statement Canvas**
Structure your problem definition:

**Problem:** [Clear, specific problem statement]
**Impact:** [Who is affected and how]
**Context:** [When and where does this happen]
**Root Cause:** [Why does this problem exist]
**Success Criteria:** [How will we know it's solved]

**Step 4: Hypothesis Formation**
Convert insights into testable assumptions:

**Format:** "We believe that [assumption] will result in [outcome]"

**Examples:**
- We believe that small business owners will pay $50/month for inventory tracking
- We believe that mobile-first design will increase adoption by 40%
- We believe that automated reordering will reduce stockouts by 60%

**Step 5: Success Metrics Definition**
Define how you'll measure success:

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- User adoption rate
- Time to value
- Retention rate
- Revenue impact

**Qualitative Metrics:**
- User satisfaction
- Ease of use
- Problem resolution
- User advocacy

**Next Steps:**
1. Refine your POV statement
2. Generate 10+ HMW questions
3. Create testable hypotheses

üí° **IDEATE PHASE: Solution Ideation (Methodology Bridge)**

**Step 1: Brainstorming Canvas**
Use structured ideation techniques:

**Crazy 8s:**
- Set a timer for 8 minutes

- Don't judge, just create

**SCAMPER Technique:**
- **Substitute:** What can we substitute?
- **Combine:** What can we combine?
- **Adapt:** What can we adapt?
- **Modify:** What can we modify?
- **Put to other uses:** What other uses?
- **Eliminate:** What can we eliminate?
- **Reverse:** What can we reverse?

**Step 2: Divergent Generation**
Create 100+ solution concepts:

**Categories to explore:**
- Digital solutions
- Physical products
- Service models
- Platform approaches
- Hybrid solutions

**Step 3: Assumption Mapping**
For each solution, identify risky assumptions:

**High-Risk Assumptions:**
- Will users pay for this?
- Is the technology feasible?
- Do we have the right team?
- Is the market big enough?

**Medium-Risk Assumptions:**
- Will users adopt this quickly?
- Can we acquire customers cost-effectively?
- Will the solution scale?

**Low-Risk Assumptions:**
- Is the problem real?
- Do we understand the user?
- Is the timing right?

**Step 4: Solution Prioritization**
Rank solutions by learning/cost ratio:

**High Learning, Low Cost:**
- Landing page tests
- Customer interviews
- Surveys
- Concierge tests

**High Learning, High Cost:**
- Prototype development
- Market research
- Technical validation

**Low Learning, Low Cost:**
- Desk research
- Competitive analysis
- Expert interviews

**Step 5: Experiment Design**
Plan minimum viable experiments:

**For each top solution:**
- What's the smallest test?
- What will we learn?
- How much will it cost?
- How long will it take?

**Next Steps:**
1. Generate 100+ ideas using different techniques
2. Map assumptions for each solution
3. Prioritize by learning potential
4. Design experiments for top 3 solutions

- **Value:** What value does it provide?
- **Channels:** How will users access it?
- **Revenue:** How will it make money?

- What questions will you ask?
- How will you capture feedback?

**Test Script:**
1. Introduction and context setting
2. Task-based testing
3. Open-ended exploration
4. Post-test interview
5. Feedback collection

**Step 5: Data Collection Setup**
Set up analytics and feedback:

**Quantitative Data:**
- Usage metrics
- Completion rates
- Time on task
- Error rates

**Qualitative Data:**
- User feedback
- Observations
- Pain points
- Suggestions
