  private contextManager: ContextManager;
  private conversationStore: ConversationStore;

  constructor() {
    this.initializeAgents();
    this.contextManager = new ContextManager();
    this.conversationStore = new ConversationStore();
  }

  async processRequest(request: AgentRequest): Promise<AgentResponse> {
    const agent = this.agents.get(request.userType);
    const context = await this.contextManager.getContext(request.userId);
    
    return await agent.processMessage({
      ...request,
      context: { ...request.context, ...context }
    });
  }
}
```

  private async analyzeBusinessPlan(businessPlan: any): Promise<AgentResponse> {
    const analysis = await aiService.generateCompletion({
      systemPrompt: this.getBusinessPlanAnalysisPrompt(),
      userMessage: JSON.stringify(businessPlan),
