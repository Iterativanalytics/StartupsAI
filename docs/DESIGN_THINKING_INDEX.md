## üéì Key Concepts Reference

### Design Thinking (DT)
Human-centered, iterative problem-solving methodology with 5 phases:
1. **Empathize**: Understand users deeply
2. **Define**: Frame the right problem
3. **Ideate**: Generate many solutions
4. **Prototype**: Build to learn
5. **Test**: Validate with users

**Purpose**: Prevent building solutions nobody wants

---

### Lean Startup
Hypothesis-driven validation methodology:
- **Build**: Create minimum viable experiment
- **Measure**: Collect data
- **Learn**: Make pivot/persevere decision

**Purpose**: Maximize learning speed, minimize wasted effort

---

### Integration: DT ‚Üí Lean ‚Üí Agile
**DT** (Discovery): What should we build? ‚Üí Validated problem + concept
**Lean** (Validation): Will it work? ‚Üí Validated hypotheses + MVP
**Agile** (Execution): How do we build it? ‚Üí Functional product

**Purpose**: End-to-end innovation process from idea to scale

---

### Critical Tools

#### Empathy Map
6-quadrant canvas: Think/Feel, Say/Do, See, Hear, Pain, Gain
**Purpose**: Understand user psychology at micro level

#### User Journey Map
End-to-end experience visualization with emotion curve
**Purpose**: Identify pain points at macro level

#### POV Statement
Formula: [User] needs [Need] because [Insight]
**Purpose**: Frame problem without suggesting solution

#### HMW Questions
Format: "How might we [action] so that [outcome]?"
**Purpose**: Open solution space, prevent premature convergence

#### Prototype Fidelity Spectrum
Lo-Fi (sketches) ‚Üí Mid-Fi (wireframes) ‚Üí Hi-Fi (functional)
**Purpose**: Match fidelity to learning goal (Goldilocks quality)

#### 5-User Testing
Test with 5 users for optimal learning ROI
**Purpose**: Uncover 85% of usability issues quickly

#### Design Sprint
5-day structured process: Map ‚Üí Sketch ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Prototype ‚Üí Test
**Purpose**: Answer critical questions in 1 week vs. 3-6 months
