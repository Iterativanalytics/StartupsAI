Purpose: Provide a dynamic, interactive tool to monitor key financial and non-financial metrics influencing startup valuation, tailored to industry and stage.

Audience: Founders, investors, and financial analysts.

Key Features:

Filters for Industry (SaaS, E-commerce, Biotech, etc.) and Stage (Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, Growth).

Contextual tooltips explaining metric significance.

Visual prioritization of metrics based on relevance.

Benchmarks against industry averages.

2. Layout & Components
A. Header Section
Filters:

Dropdowns for Industry and Stage.

Date range selector (e.g., monthly, quarterly).

Key Summary Cards:

Current Valuation (pre/post-money).

Runway (months remaining).

Burn Rate ($/month).

LTV/CAC Ratio.

B. Financial Metrics Panel
Visualizations:

Revenue Growth Rate

Line chart: YoY and MoM trends.

Benchmark line for industry average.

MRR/ARR

Bar chart with recurring revenue breakdown.

Gross Margin

Gauge showing % with thresholds (e.g., green â‰¥60%, yellow 40-60%, red <40%).

Burn Rate vs. Runway

Combination chart: Burn Rate (bar) vs. Runway (line).

CAC vs. LTV

Waterfall chart: CAC, LTV, and net profit per customer.

C. Non-Financial Metrics Panel
Visualizations:

User Engagement

Line chart: MAU/WAU trends.

Churn Rate

Donut chart: Current churn rate vs. target.

Conversion Rate

Funnel chart: User journey from visit to purchase.

Team Experience

Table: Key team members with roles, experience, and prior exits.

Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

Treemap: Visualizing market tiers.

D. Industry & Stage-Specific Metrics
Dynamic metrics based on filters (from Table 3):

SaaS: Highlight NDR, ARR, and churn rate.

E-commerce: GMV, take rate, and website traffic.

Biotech: Clinical trial milestones and IP status.

Pre-seed: Team experience and TAM.

Growth Stage: Scalability metrics and EBITDA.

E. Comparative Analysis Section
Benchmarking:

Side-by-side bar charts comparing startup metrics to industry averages.

Example: CAC vs. industry median.

Valuation Method Summary:

Table showing applicable valuation methods (DCF, VC Method, etc.) based on stage.

3. Design Elements
Color Scheme:

Neutral base (dark gray/white) with accent colors for metrics (e.g., green for growth, red for churn).

Interactivity:

Hover tooltips with metric definitions and formulas.

Drill-down into specific metrics (e.g., click MRR to view subscription tiers).

Responsiveness:

Grid layout adaptable to desktop and tablet screens.

4. Example View for SaaS (Series A)
Header:

Filters: Industry = SaaS, Stage = Series A.

Summary Cards: Runway = 18 months, LTV/CAC = 4.5x.

Financial Panel:

MRR growth at 20% MoM (vs. industry 15%).

Non-Financial Panel:

Churn Rate = 5% (below industry 8%).

Industry-Specific:

NDR = 120% (highlighted in green).

5. Tools & Implementation
Platform: Tableau, Power BI, or custom React/D3.js.

Data Integration: Connect to accounting software (QuickBooks), CRM (HubSpot), and analytics tools (Google Analytics).
