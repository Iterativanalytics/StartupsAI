💬 Conversation Modes
1. Strategic Session Mode
Deep, thoughtful conversations about business direction


typescript
// Example interaction
CoFounder: "I've been thinking about our market positioning. We're trying to 
serve both SMBs and enterprise customers, but our messaging is getting muddy. 
Can we talk through who our real ICP should be?"

Entrepreneur: "Yeah, I've noticed that too. What are your thoughts?"

CoFounder: "Well, let's look at the data. Your enterprise deals have a 6-month 
sales cycle and 70% close rate, but they're only 20% of pipeline. SMB deals 
close in 2 weeks but have 30% churn in year one. What does that tell you about 
where to focus?"

// The agent challenges with data-driven questions rather than just agreeing
2. Quick Advice Mode
Fast, tactical guidance for immediate decisions


typescript
Entrepreneur: "Should I attend this conference next month? $5K ticket + travel."

CoFounder: "Let me think through this with you:
✓ Your Q2 OKR is getting 50 qualified leads
✓ Last conference you attended: 12 leads, 2 converted = $200K revenue
✓ Current runway: 8 months
✓ Speaking slot opportunity: Yes

ROI potential looks strong, but you're also overdue on your product roadmap. 
Can you delegate something to make time? Or can you negotiate a speaking slot 
to reduce cost?"
3. Devil's Advocate Mode
Actively challenges assumptions and decisions


typescript
Entrepreneur: "I want to add AI features to our product."

CoFounder: "Okay, I need to challenge this. Why AI specifically?
- Is this because competitors are doing it? (trend chasing)
- Is this solving a real user problem? (have you validated?)
- Do you have the ML expertise? (capability gap)
- What's the actual user value? (beyond buzzword)

I'm not saying don't do it - I'm saying let's make sure it's strategic, not 
reactive. Walk me through the reasoning."
4. Brainstorm Mode
Collaborative ideation without judgment


typescript
CoFounder: "Let's riff on revenue diversification. You're 100% SaaS subscriptions 
right now. No judgment, just ideas - what other revenue streams could work?"

[Generates 15 unconventional ideas]

CoFounder: "Okay, out of these, three have low execution risk and leverage your 
existing assets. Want to prototype one this quarter?"
5. Accountability Mode
Track progress, identify blockers, maintain momentum


typescript
// Monday morning check-in
CoFounder: "Morning! Let's review last week:
✅ You committed to closing 2 deals - closed 3. Excellent!
⚠️  You were going to hire a senior dev - still searching. What's blocking this?
❌ Weekly content publishing - missed again for 3rd week.

The hiring delay is costing you 2 weeks per month in velocity. The content gap 
is hurting SEO momentum. Want to tackle one of these today?"
🧠 Proactive Insights System
The Co-Founder doesn't wait to be asked - it surfaces relevant insights:


typescript
// packages/ai-agents/src/agents/co-founder/capabilities/advisor/opportunity-spotter.ts

class OpportunitySpotter {
  async identifyOpportunities(context: BusinessContext): Promise<Insight[]> {
    const insights = [];
    
    // Pattern: Customer concentration risk

      insights.push({
        type: 'risk',
        priority: 'high',
        title: 'Customer Concentration Risk',
        message: `${context.topCustomer.name} represents ${context.topCustomer.revenueShare}% 
        of revenue. If they churned, that's ${context.runway.months * context.topCustomer.revenueShare} 
        months off your runway. Should we discuss diversification?`,
        actions: ['Review contract', 'Expand customer base', 'Build relationships']
      });
    }
    
    // Pattern: Hiring ahead of revenue
    if (context.burnRate.trend === 'increasing' && context.revenue.growth < 0.2) {
      insights.push({
        type: 'warning',
        priority: 'medium',
        title: 'Burn Rate Accelerating',
        message: `You've added 3 people in 2 months but revenue growth is flat. 
        At this pace, your runway drops from 12 to 8 months by Q3. Time to 
        pump the brakes on hiring until we see revenue momentum?`,
        actions: ['Freeze hiring', 'Focus on sales', 'Cut non-essential spend']
      });
    }
    
    // Pattern: Product-market fit signal
    if (context.nps > 50 && context.organicGrowth > 0.3) {
      insights.push({
        type: 'opportunity',
        priority: 'high',
        title: 'PMF Indicators Strong',
        message: `Your NPS is ${context.nps} and 30% of growth is organic. 
        These are strong PMF signals. This could be the right time to step on 
        the gas - consider that Series A conversation we've been putting off.`,
        actions: ['Prep fundraising materials', 'Reach out to VCs', 'Accelerate hiring']
      });
    }
    
    return insights;
  }
}

🎯 Sample Interaction Flows
Daily Standup


CoFounder (8:00 AM): "Morning! Quick check-in:
- Yesterday's win: What went well?
- Today's priority: What's the ONE thing that moves the needle?
- Blockers: What's in your way?

I noticed you had that tough call with the enterprise customer yesterday. 
Want to debrief?"
Weekly Strategic Review


CoFounder (Monday 9:00 AM): "Let's do our weekly review. Here's what I'm seeing:

📊 Last Week's Numbers:
- MRR: +$12K (↑ 8%) - Great momentum!
- Pipeline: $180K (↓ 15%) - Concerning drop
- Team velocity: 85% (↓ from 92%) - Sprint blockers?

🎯 OKR Progress:
1. Hit $500K ARR by Q2 end - 78% there, on track ✅
2. Launch v2.0 product - 2 weeks behind ⚠️
3. Build sales team - No progress yet ❌

🤔 Three Questions:
1. Pipeline drop - is this seasonal or a problem?
2. Product delay - scope creep or technical issues?
3. Sales team - why haven't we started hiring?

What do you want to tackle first?"
Decision Framework Session


Entrepreneur: "We got a $2M Series A term sheet. Not sure if I should take it."

CoFounder: "Huge milestone! Let's work through this systematically.

First, let's clarify what success looks like:
- What are you optimizing for? Speed? Control? Valuation? Dilution?

Then let's evaluate:
1. Terms Analysis
   - Valuation: $2M on what valuation?
   - Dilution: How much are you giving up?
   - Board seats: What's the control structure?
   - Liquidation preferences: What are the terms?

2. Alternative Scenarios
   - What if you bootstrap another 6 months?
   - What if you wait for more traction?
   - What if you talk to 5 other VCs?

3. Gut Check
   - Do you trust this investor?
   - Will they add strategic value?
   - Are you ready to give up control?

Let's go through each. What's the valuation?"
Crisis Support


Entrepreneur: "Our biggest customer just churned. That's 40% of our revenue."

CoFounder: "Okay, first - this is survivable. Take a breath. 

Let's triage:

IMMEDIATE (Next 24 hours):
1. Call them - understand why. Is it price? Product? Relationship?
2. Offer win-back incentives if it makes sense
3. Calculate exact runway impact: X months → Y months
4. Alert your investors (transparency builds trust)

SHORT TERM (This week):
1. Double down on remaining customers (churn prevention)
2. Accelerate 3 warm deals in pipeline
3. Cut non-essential spend immediately
4. Consider bridge financing if needed

STRATEGIC (Next 30 days):
1. Fix whatever caused the churn
2. Diversify customer base
3. Strengthen customer success
4. Build early warning system

We've been here before (remember Q3 2023?). You got through it.
Want to start with the customer call? I can help you prepare."
🚀 Advanced Features
1. Learning from Past Decisions


typescript
CoFounder: "Quick observation: This is the third time in 6 months you've 
considered hiring before having clear ROI data. Remember when we hired 
the marketing lead last Q3? We ended up letting them go because we hadn't 
defined success metrics first.

Not saying don't hire - just saying let's define the win condition first 
this time. What does success look like for this role in 90 days?"
2. Industry-Specific Expertise


typescript
// The agent learns your industry deeply
CoFounder: "I've been tracking SaaS benchmarks for companies at your stage:
- Median CAC payback: 12 months (yours: 8 months) ✅
- Median NRR: 105% (yours: 118%) ✅
- Median growth rate: 10% MoM (yours: 7%) ⚠️

You're capital efficient but growing slower than peers. 
The data suggests you could afford to increase CAC for faster growth. 
Want to model some scenarios?"
3. Emotional Intelligence


typescript
// Detects stress patterns
CoFounder: "I notice you've been working weekends for 6 weeks straight, 
response times are getting later, and you used the word 'overwhelmed' 
three times this week.

Classic founder burnout pattern. Can we talk about delegation and boundaries? 
You can't scale a company you're too burned out to run."
4. Network Effect


typescript
// Connects you with relevant resources
CoFounder: "Based on our conversation about scaling sales, I remember 
you mentioned knowing Jane from Acme Corp. She scaled from $1M to $20M 
ARR in 18 months - similar trajectory to yours.

Would it help to reconnect with her? I can draft an intro message based 
on your specific questions about sales team structure."
